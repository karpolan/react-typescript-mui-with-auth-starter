# IMPORTANT UPDATE 2024-05-01

Better use [Vite + React + MUI starter](https://github.com/karpolan/react-mui-vite-ts) instead of this one.

Reasons:
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is **not popular** anymore.
- Development and debugging using **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** is 10x faster than with Webpack.


# React + Material UI + Auth starter using TypeScript

The **TypeScript** edition of **Create React App** plus **Material UI** with set of **reusable components** and utilities to build professional **React Application** faster.

- [Source Code](https://github.com/karpolan/react-typescript-material-ui-with-auth-starter)
- [Online Demo](https://react-typescript-material.netlify.app/)

## How to use

1. Clone or download the repo from: https://github.com/karpolan/react-typescript-material-ui-with-auth-starter
2. Replace `_TITLE_` and `_DESCRIPTION_` in all files with own texts
3. Create **Favorite Icon** images and put them into `/public/img/favicon`, the **favicon.ico** file should be paced into root of `/public` folder.
4. Add your own code :)
